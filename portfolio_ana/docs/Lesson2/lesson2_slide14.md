# **Lesson 2: Qualitative Analysis with LLMs**

## **Slide 14: Course Conclusion**

* **Quant (Python)** is your *filter*. It's fast, cheap, and objective.  
* **Qual (LLM)** is your *analyst*. It's slow, expensive (time/compute), and subjective.  
* **NEVER** blindly trust the Quant screen.  
* **NEVER** blindly trust the LLM's analysis.  
* The human (YOU!) is the final decision-maker, using Python to filter noise and LLMs to suggest insights.  
* **This workflow (Quant -> Qual) is the future of financial analysis.**
