# **Lesson 2: Qualitative Analysis with LLMs**

## **Slide 13: Interpreting the Output (The Final Step)**

* The LLM gives us a beautifully written report. Now what?  
* **Pros of the LLM Output:**  
  * Finds trends we might miss (e.g., "I see EPS is rising but margin is shrinking").  
  * Excellent at summarizing data into human-readable text.  
  * Provides a "second opinion."  
* **Cons (DANGERS):**  
  * **Hallucination:** It might "invent" reasons or data we didn't provide. (e.g., "This is due to their new factory...") -> We must verify!  
  * **Overconfidence:** It will *sound* 100% correct, even when it's just guessing.  
  * **Garbage In, Garbage Out:** If our data summary (RAG) is bad, the analysis will be bad.
