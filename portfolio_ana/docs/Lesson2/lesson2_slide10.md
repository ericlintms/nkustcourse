# **Lesson 2: Qualitative Analysis with LLMs**

## **Slide 10: Step 3: Prompt Engineering**

* Now we build our "Good Prompt" using RAG.  
* A good prompt has three parts:  
  1. **System Prompt (The Role):** "Who you are."  
  2. **Context (The Data):** "What you know." (This is our RAG summary)  
  3. **User Query (The Task):** "What to do."
