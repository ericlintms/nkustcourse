# **Lesson 2: Qualitative Analysis with LLMs**

## **Slide 4: Our New Tool: Ollama**

* **Ollama** is a tool that lets us run powerful open-source LLMs (like llama3 or mistral) on our local machine.  
* It creates a simple API server at http://localhost:11434.  
* Our Python script can send a "prompt" to this server and get an "analysis" back.  
* **Key Benefit:** Our private financial data **never leaves our computer**. This is critical for data privacy.
