# **Lesson 2: Qualitative Analysis with LLMs**

## **Slide 6: The Core Challenge of This Lesson**

* We have selected_stocks.csv (e.g., Stock 1101, 2330).  
* We have an LLM.  
* **PROBLEM:** If we ask the LLM, "Should I buy stock 1101?", what happens?  
* **ANSWER:** The LLM knows nothing about stock 1101's data from *our private fin_data_smallset.csv file*.  
* Its training data is old (e.g., from 2023) and generic. It cannot see our files.
