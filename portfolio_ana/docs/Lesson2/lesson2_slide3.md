# **Lesson 2: Qualitative Analysis with LLMs**

## **Slide 3: Today's Objective**

* Today, we find out **WHY**.  
* **The Problem:** A stock with "EPS > 1" could be:  
  * **A:** A great company on a growth trend.  
  * **B:** A terrible company that had one lucky quarter.  
* **Our Quant screen can't tell the difference.** A number is just a number.  
* We need **context**, **trends**, and **nuance**.  
* **Goal:** We will use an LLM to provide this qualitative analysis.
