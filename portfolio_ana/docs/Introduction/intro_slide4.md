# **Introduction to LLMs for Finance**

## **Slide 4: Key Terminology (Part 2)**

* **API (Application Programming Interface):** A "menu" that lets one computer program (our Python script) talk to another (the LLM).  
* **Cloud LLM:** The model runs on someone else's powerful computer (e.g., OpenAI, Google). You pay per use.  
* **Local LLM (Our Focus):** The model runs entirely on *your* own computer.  
  * **Tool:** We will use **Ollama** to serve a local model.  
  * **Pros:** Free, private (your data never leaves your machine).  
  * **Cons:** Requires a good computer (GPU), may be slower.
