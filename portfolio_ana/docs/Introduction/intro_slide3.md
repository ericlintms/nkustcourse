# **Introduction to LLMs for Finance**

## **Slide 3: Key Terminology (Part 1)**

* **Prompt:** The instruction or question you give to the LLM.  
  * *Prompt engineering* is the art of writing good prompts to get good answers.  
* **Token:** The basic unit of text for an LLM (roughly a word or part of a word).  
  * "Financial analysis" might be 2 or 3 tokens.  
  * Model context windows (e.g., 8K, 128K) are measured in tokens.  
* **Model:** The specific "brain" you are talking to (e.g., llama3, gpt-4, mistral).  
* **Hallucination:** When the LLM confidently states incorrect or fabricated "facts." It's a major risk we must manage.
