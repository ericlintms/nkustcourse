# **Lesson 1: Quantitative Stock Screening with Python**

## **Slide 7: Step 2: Define Our "Why" (Financial Metrics)**

* We need rules for our screener.  
* **CRITICAL LIMITATION:** Our dataset has **NO STOCK PRICE** data.  
* Therefore, we **cannot** calculate common ratios like:  
  * P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings)  
  * P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book)  
* **Solution:** We will use **fundamentals-only** metrics.
