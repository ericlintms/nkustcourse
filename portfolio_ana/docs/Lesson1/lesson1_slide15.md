# **Lesson 1: Quantitative Stock Screening with Python**

## **Slide 15: Lesson 1 Review**

* We started with a large, messy CSV.  
* We used **Pandas** to **Clean** data.  
* We **Engineered** new metrics (Current Ratio, Op. Margin).  
* We **Filtered** for the latest data.  
* We **Screened** for stocks matching our rules.  
* **Result:** A short, clean list of *quantitatively* interesting stocks.

**Next Time:** We find out *why* they are interesting.
